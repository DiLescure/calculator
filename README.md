# Calculator without eval()
### by Diana Lescure

## Description

This calculator uses the library [Big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js) to deal with decimal math.

It can do basic math functions with decimal numbers.

## Running tests

I used [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) (standalone) to create unit specs for the actual math functions (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division).

In order to run Jasmine, simply open the file `SpecRunner.html` on the browser.

## Device support for UI

The UI supports the following devices:

- Desktop
- Tablets
- Smartphones

To see the media queries handling each case, please open the [Calculator](http://dianitica.github.io/calculator/) in the respective device.
